Data Engineer GCP Journey ðŸš€
Overview
This repository documents my learning path to becoming a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Data Engineer. It contains notes, code samples, hands-on labs, and resources that I am exploring as I build expertise in various aspects of GCP's data engineering tools and services.

Goals
My goal is to:

Master the key concepts and tools for data engineering on GCP.
Build projects that involve end-to-end data pipelines using GCP services.
Earn the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Certification.
Share my learning journey and help others aspiring to become GCP Data Engineers.
